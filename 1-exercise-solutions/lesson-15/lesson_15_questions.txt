// ðŸ”¹ Push & Pop
1. Create an array of your favorite fruits. Add two more fruits using push(), then remove the last fruit using pop(). What does the final array look like?
2. Start with an empty array. Use push() to add 3 numbers, then use pop() twice. What remains in the array?

// ðŸ”¹ Unshift & Shift
3. Given an array ["b", "c"], use unshift() to add "a" at the beginning. Then use shift() to remove the first element. What is left in the array?
4. Use unshift() to add 3 numbers to the beginning of an array, and then remove the first two using shift(). What is the output?

// ðŸ”¹ Splice
5. Given ["a", "b", "c", "d"], use splice() to replace "b" and "c" with "x" and "y". What is the result?
6. Remove the last 2 elements of an array using splice().
7. Insert "middle" at index 2 in the array ["start", "next", "next", "end"] using splice() without deleting anything.

// ðŸ”¹ Includes & IndexOf
8. Check if the value 100 exists in the array [10, 20, 30, 100] using includes().
9. Find the index of the word "hello" in the array ["hi", "hello", "hey"].
10. If an element is not found using indexOf(), what value does it return?

// ðŸ”¹ Concat
11. Concatenate two arrays: [1, 2] and [3, 4] into a new array.
12. Merge three arrays: ["a"], ["b", "c"], and ["d"] into one using concat().

// ðŸ”¹ Join
13. Convert the array ["JavaScript", "is", "fun"] into a sentence using join().
14. Use join() to turn [1, 2, 3, 4] into the string "1-2-3-4".

// ðŸ”¹ Copying Arrays
15. Copy an array [1, 2, 3] using slice(), then modify the copied array. Does the original array change?
16. Use the spread operator to copy an array and add a new value to the end. What does the copied array look like?

// ðŸ”¹ Destructuring
17. Destructure the first two elements from [10, 20, 30] into separate variables.
18. Destructure an array [1, 2, 3, 4] to skip the second value and capture the third in a variable.
19. Use array destructuring with the rest operator to store the first value in x and the rest in y.
